MorseToText/TextToMorse converter.
## Objective
Implement Hash Tables and Binary Trees to create a program that will convert Morse to Text and Text to Morse.
## What I learned
Binary trees are a very interesting data structure to get into. It was difficult to program into at first due to the nature of the structure itself, but I learned how to make use of it and as a result I found it to be my favorite structure. Also, implementing pointers to represent a tree and be ugly without a proper way to deallocate the tree.
## How to run
```git clone``` the repo and run ```g++ *.cpp```.
## Credits
- Evan Brannon-Wu, teammate.
- Dmitry, Zara, worked on implementation of Hash Table from previous coursework.
